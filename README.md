## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Started to look at using `clamp()` for font sizing. I used [this calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) to help with the preferred font-sizing. I also having tried to use more responsive units, such as 'rem', within my code.

### Continued development

I will continue to try to implement responsive units and use `clamp()` to build in responsiveness to websites.

## Useful Resources

[Fluid Typography Calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/)
 - A good little resource to help work out the values for `clamp()` when working with changing font sizes across screen sizes.
